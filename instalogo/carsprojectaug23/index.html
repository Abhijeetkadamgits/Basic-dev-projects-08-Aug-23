      <h2 class="font">Chevrolet Corvette</h2>
      <p>Though there is an assortment of brand-new and fully redesigned passenger cars hitting the road for 2020 model year, their numbers are dwindling as buyers are instead choosing sport-utility vehicles as their rides of choice. Stalwart sedans like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus are being discontinued, with the number of small cars in particular thinning rapidly. While there were 26 subcompact models on the market as recently as 2016, they’re down to just 17 for 2019, with the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic reportedly bowing out at the end of the current model year.</p>

      <h2 class="font">Aston Martin Rapide E</h2>
      <p>The famed British exotic sports-car maker Aston Martin is building a full-electric version of the gorgeous and capable Rapide coupe. It comes wrapped in aluminum and carbon fiber body panels, and packs dual rear-mounted motors that generate over 600 horsepower with 700 pound-feet of torque. That should enable a 0-60 mph time under four seconds; top speed is 155 mph. It’s expected to run for over 200 miles on a charge. Production will be limited to 155 units and it should cost around $260,000.</p>

      <h2 class="font">Cadillac CT5</h2>
      <p>Cadillac introduces a new compact luxury sedan for 2020, the CT4. Adorned with uncluttered styling, it fills the slot in the lineup that was vacated when the ATS was discontinued. Few details on the base model are available as of this writing, but we do know it will be rear drive with all-wheel-drive available, and come powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Cadillac has, however, released preliminary information on the sporty CT4-V model, which will feature a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine with an estimated 320 horsepower, a near perfect 50/50 front to rear weight ratio, grippy Brembo brakes, and precise handling abilities. Available features include Cadillac’s semi-autonomous Super Cruise system that allows hands-free highway driving.</p>
